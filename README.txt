The User Level Themes plugin allows a site admin to specify the site's theme based on the user's access level.

== Description ==

The User Level Themes plugin allows a site administrator to select different themes for users with and without administrative
access rights. This feature can be used to safely test a new theme while redirecting visitors to a known working theme. This plugin
utilizes the [Wordpress Plugin Framework] (http://www.doubleblackdesign.com/categories/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-plugin-framework/ "Wordpress Plugin Framework") to
provide a standard administration interface and allow for simplified plugin management.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which theme is displayed when I deactivate / uninstall this plugin? =

The User Level Themes plugin attempts to revert to the theme (labeled as the "Default Theme") was being utilized at the
time the User Level Themes plugin was initially activated. However, if this theme is no longer available then the User
Level Themes plugin will allow the Wordpress core to select the next available theme in the theme list. The selected
theme will then be displayed for all user levels.
